        <h1>The Old Man and The Sea</h1>
        <p>The Old Man and the Sea is a novel by Ernest Hemingway, published in 1952. It follows Santiago, an aging Cuban
        fisherman who has gone 84 days without catching a fish. Determined to end his unlucky streak, he ventures far into the
        Gulf Stream, where he hooks a massive marlin. After an intense three-day struggle, he finally kills the fish, only for
        sharks to attack and eat most of it on his journey home. In the end, Santiago returns to shore with only the fish’s
        skeleton, exhausted but undefeated in spirit. The novel explores themes of perseverance, resilience, and man's struggle
        against nature.</p>

        <h4>Review</h4>
        <p>The novel is a force of nature in itself, Hemingway's writing leaves a deep marks in it's reader, and implores in us a deep
            respect for nature. The forces in the story are wonderfully balanced, the Old Man Santiago, who is poor but richer than most
            in his understanding of nature's bounties and cruelties. The Marlin, who is almost otherworldy in beauty, is both Santiago's
            deliverance from his plight, and nature's uncaring cycle of life and death. The Marlin itself is the sea, and at the same time, 
            Santiago himself is also the sea. A novel that everyone should read, it is a classic through and through.</p>
